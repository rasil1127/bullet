First Person Shooter in HTML5 with ThreeJS and WebGL

At this point this is a very basic "game".  The Code is sloppy, but getting better every day, except on the days where I make things worst.  But hey, even 3D Realms had "Lame Duke" (http://www.3drealms.com/duke3d/lameduke.html) and they were a group of people.  At this point it's only me, and I have no clue what I'm doing :)

But really, I've done a lot of playing around with 3D design over the past 15 years.  Back in the day I use to make my own Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D mods.  I've made simple games in Blender 3D.  But this will be my first FPS from scratch using HTML5. 

------------------------
My GOAL!
------------------------
"You know, people have already done this."
Yeah, I know.  But I want to make my own and make it simple to mod.

I just want to make a simple game that is easy for people to customize and create their own games.  I want people to be able to create a level in Blender and load it, as well as any new sounds, music, or images, into what I create and have something ready to go that they can tweek all they want.

Your Help
-----------------------
I could always use help with any aspect of the game.  So, let me know if you want to help.
And if you don't want to help, it's ok.  I can handle my own.  Just like that time on the base on Mars.


Anyway, I need to get back to working on this game (it obviously needs it).
